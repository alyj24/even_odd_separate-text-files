# Extracting Even and Odd Numbers to Separated Files
Problem 1 in Assignment 4
# Problem
```bash
Writing a Python Program that creates a text file named "numbers.txt" that will contaoin 20 integers and read it. Then, the program will extract the even and odd numbers to two different text files which named "even.txt" and "odd.txt" from the first created file.
```
# About the Program
This program teach me how to use the open, append, write functions in Python. I enjoyed exploring this language or the coding itself in this problem even though I spent a lot of time doing it, for a reason, I am trying to do it myself just with my notes and what I have learned from the online session with our Professor Dan. I kept on trusting my knowledge that I can finish it without searching anything, nonetheless, it was worth it.
# Installation
I used PyCharm Community Edition 2020.3.1 for coding the lines.
```bash
pycharm64.exe
```
# Usage
with, as = using this in Python guarantees that resources are promptly closed after being processed.

read = r

write = w

append = a

# Launch
$ git clone https://github.com/alyj24/even_odd_separate-text-files.git

$ git add -A

$ git commit -m ""

$ git push
